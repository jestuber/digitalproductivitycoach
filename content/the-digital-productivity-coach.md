## "I constantly try new apps and tools to get organized and yet I never get anything done!"

If you want to level-up your productivity, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. 

There are dozens of systems and tools and acronyms and it all sounds so complicated.

You read blog post after blog post, waiting for some kind of "a-ha!" moment.

How do you choose what to work on? Who should you listen to? Why is there so much conflicting advice? Why are all the productivity gurus prattling on about ‘hacks’ or crazy theoretical jargon?

<h2 style="color: #d0194b;">What if you were shown just one step towards improved productivity?</h2>

You could quit worrying if you were on the right path.

You could settle on one system, instead of bouncing back and forth between apps.

You could stop feeling paralyzed by your never-ending todo list.

_You might even get some work done._

## How can you make productivity tools serve you, instead of the other way around?

When you first start learning how to be productive, it's _so_ tempting to go all-out trying to build the _perfect_ system for you.

But the goal of productivity tools isn't to play around with productivity tools.

The goal is to get your work done.

What you need is a sane default. A system that works great for most people.

Build consistency first. Then you can adjust based on experience, not blog posts.

## Level up your productivity and start getting work done, by using the Digital Productivity Coach

When you first open the Digital Productivity Coach, here's exactly what you'll do:

* You'll answer a few simple questions about your current workflow
* The coach will recommend one high-impact skill to work on
* You'll take that action step and start making improvements to your productivity right away
* You'll practice that skill
* When you feel comfortable, ask the Digital Productivity Coach for your next step

Over time you'll build a complete Productivity System. With each small step, you'll see your outcomes improve for the work you care about the most.

## FAQ

#### Who is the Digital Productivity Coach *not* for?

* You're happy with your productivity systems.
