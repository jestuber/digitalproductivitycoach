## FAQ

#### Who is the Digital Productivity Coach *not* for?
You don't need this if:

* You're a Getting Things Done pro.
* You've taken the [Building a Second Brain](https://buildingasecondbrain.com) course and feel confident in the skills you've learned.
* You're happy with your productivity systems.

#### Why is this available for free?

1. We want to share what we know as widely as possible. Productivity systems like the ones you can learn from The Coach are *empowering*, and we wish to remove barriers to entry where possible.
2. We're able to recoup the costs of hosting and development through your generosity, affliate links to products we personally use & vouch for, and new coaching clients.

#### Who are you?
The Digital Productivity Coach was built by productivity nerds Tasshin Fogleman and James Stuber. More about us [here](/about).

<!-- #### How does this relate to GTD and BASB?
