The Digital Productivity Coach was built by productivity nerds Tasshin Fogleman and James Stuber. 

Colleagues, clients, and friends were asking both of us for productivity tips. While we're happy to teach, one-on-ones are time consuming and hard to schedule.

We searched for a single, easy-to-use resource to share with others, but couldn't find one. Instead of giving up, we built our own: [The Digital Productivity Coach](/).
