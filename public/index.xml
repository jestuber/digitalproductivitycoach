      <description>About The Digital Productivity Coach was built by productivity nerds Tasshin Fogleman and James Stuber.
Colleagues, clients, and friends were asking both of us for productivity tips. While we&amp;rsquo;re happy to teach, one-on-ones are time consuming and hard to schedule.
We searched for a single, easy-to-use resource to share with others, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find one. Instead of giving up, we built our own: The Digital Productivity Coach.
Tasshin Fogleman Tasshin is the Assistant Director at the Monastic Academy in Lowell, VT.</description>
